# Viora

**Viora** is an e-commerce website designed to showcase my skills in design and front-end development. The project features a clean and functional interface with basic e-commerce functionality. It is a personal project meant to be included in my portfolio.

- The project is hosted on GitHub Pages here: [Viora]()
- Node Version: 20.11.0 and up

### Design
I designed the wireframes and mockups for the project in **Figma**, making updates throughout the development process to reflect design changes and maintain consistency. Below are links to both:
